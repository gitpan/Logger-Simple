NAME
    Logger::Simple - Implementation of the Simran-Log-Log and
    Simran-Error-Error modules

SYNOPSIS
      use Logger::Simple;
      my $log=Logger::Simple->new(LOG=>"/tmp/program.log");
      my $x=5;my $y=4;
      
  if($x>$y){
        $log->write("\$x is greater than \$y");
      }

DESCRIPTION
    new  "my $log=Logger::Simple->new(LOG=>"/tmp/logfile");"

         The new method creates the Logger::Simple object as an inside-out
         object. The Log parameter is a mandatory one that must be passed to
         the object at creation, or the object will fail. Upon creation,
         this method will also call the open_log method which opens the log
         file.

    write
         "$log->write("This is an error message");"

         This method will write a message to the logfile, and will update
         the internal HISTORY array.

    retrieve_history
         "my @history = $log->retrieve_history;"
	 "my $msg = $log->retrieve_history;"

         When called in scalar context, it will return the last message
         written to the HISTORY array. When called in a list context, it
         will return the entire HISTORY array

    clear_history
         "$log->clear_history;"

         This method will clear the internal HISTORY array

EXPORT
    None by default.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    This module is based on the Simran::Log::Log and Simran::Error::Error
    modules. I liked the principle behind them, but felt that the interface
    could be a bit better.

    My thanks also goes out once again to Damian Conway for Object Oriented
    Perl, and also to Sam Tregar, for his book "Writing Perl Modules for
    CPAN". Both were invaluable references for me.

    I would also like to thank Jerry Heden for his Object::InsideOut module,
    which I used to create this module.
